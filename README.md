# Quench

Harden your Foundry module or system code with end-to-end UI tests directly within Foundry.
Powered by [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and also includes [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).

Quench adds a test runner UI as a native Foundry `Application`.
You can register test suites with quench and view them in the test runner, then run them and view the results.
